New Features in HTML5:
1. New Semantic Elements - <header>. <footer>, <section>.
2. New attributes have been introduced for <input> tag in Form2.0
3. Persistent Local Storage: 
4. WebSocket: Bidirectional COmmunication Technology for Web Applicaitons
5. Server-Sent Events: Events which flow from Server to Web Browsers
6. Canvas: This supports two dimensional drawing surface than can be programmed using javascript
7. Audio & Vedio: Audio/Vedio can be embedded without using third party plugins
8. GeoLocation: Option to share thier physical location with your web Browsers
9. Microdata: Options to create own Vocabularies beyond HTML5 and extend

AJAX: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, is used for exhanging Data between Server and Browser without reloading the whole page.
AJAX is used for creating fast and dynamic webpages

(XMLHTTPRequest -> send HTTPRequest Asynchronously -> server process the Reqeust -> Send Back to Browser -> Process the Response by JavaSript ->Update the Content)
    AJAX Uses the Combination of: XMLHTTPRequest, JavaScript/DOM, CSS, XML. 

xmlhttp.open(metohd,url,async)
xmlhttp.send(string)

GET vs POST (Get is simpler and faster than POST / POST is used for larger amount of data / For user input better to use POST becuase it is secure and Robust)
- XMLHTTPRequest.responseText/responseXML
- onReadyStateChange: Has a function which automatically calls whenever the readyState property changes
- readyState: Status ranges from 0-4. 0(Not Initialised), 1(Server Connection Established), 2(Request Recieved), 3(Processing Reqeust), 4(Request is fineshed and response is ready)
- status: 200 (OK) / 404 (Page Not Found)

HTML: Block level Elements and Inline Elements
IFrame: Used to Display a WebPage within a WebPage

In the <head> we can include the following tags:
- title: Title of the WebPage
- link: Usually to link the StyleSheet ('rel')
- script: Javascript / php part, to make the webpage dynamic (getElementByID("name").innerHTML)
- meta: name, charset, http=equiv(for reloading the webpage in intervals)
- base: specify base URL and base targets for all relative URLs

UTF-8 charset contains almost all symbols in the World

URL Format: scheme://hostname.domain:port/path/filename 
            - scheme (http)
            - hostname (www)
            - domain (w3schools.com)
            - Path at the Server
            - name of the File at the server

URL Encoding: URLs are sent over internet in ASCII format, so the URLs has to converted into ASCII format. This process is called URL Encoding
              For Eg. A space cannot be present in the encoded URL, so it is replaced with %20 (Hexadecimal) or + (plus)
